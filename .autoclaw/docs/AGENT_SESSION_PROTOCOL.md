# AutoClaw Agent Session Protocol

_Status: active, 2026-05-21. The hardened replacement for ad-hoc
"check the inbox and `/loop` forever" prompts._

This document is the **single source of truth** for how any AI coding agent
(Claude Code, Kilo Code, Cursor, Kiro, Gemini CLI / Antigravity, Cline,
Continue, Windsurf, Codex, Hermes, OpenClaw) joins an AutoClaw-orchestrated
project, coordinates with peers, and works a continuous loop **safely**.

It supersedes the free-text prompts users were pasting per session. Those
prompts had the right instincts — register, check inbox, work in parallel,
report back, keep going — but no exit conditions, no cost ceiling, no
conflict handling, and no per-host dispatch awareness. This protocol keeps
the instincts and adds the guardrails.

> **Per-host quick start:** jump to §7 for the exact copy-paste bootstrap
> prompt for your agent. Everything before §7 is the shared contract that
> every host obeys.

---

## 1. The session lifecycle — six phases

Every agent session, on every host, runs the same loop:

```
        ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
        ▼                                             │
  REGISTER ──▶ SYNC ──▶ CLAIM ──▶ WORK ──▶ REPORT ──▶ LOOP
   (once)     (bus)    (atomic)  (scoped)  (bus)     (gated)
```

| Phase | What happens | Files touched |
|---|---|---|
| **REGISTER** | Announce identity + `session_id`; write first heartbeat. | `comms/heartbeats/<agent>.json`, `comms/registry.json` |
| **SYNC** | Read inbox + shared; process each message; archive to `processed/`. | `comms/inboxes/<agent>/`, `.../shared/`, `_state/` |
| **CLAIM** | Find an unclaimed in-scope task; claim it atomically with a token. | `comms/claims/`, sprint YAMLs |
| **WORK** | Do the task — **only inside the claimed scope**. | source files in scope |
| **REPORT** | Broadcast `task_complete`; request review; vote on open consensus. | `.../shared/`, peer inboxes, `comms/consensus/active/` |
| **LOOP** | Re-evaluate stop conditions; heartbeat; back to SYNC — or halt. | `comms/heartbeats/<agent>.json` |

REGISTER runs once per session. SYNC→REPORT is one **work cycle**. LOOP
decides whether another cycle runs.

---

## 2. Identity & the comms bus

The bus is the filesystem under `.autoclaw/orchestrator/comms/`. No network
required for local coordination.

```
.autoclaw/orchestrator/
  state.json                       # SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for state
  config.yaml                      # project + agent config
  comms/
    registry.json                  # known agents (one row per agent id)
    comms-log.jsonl                # append-only audit log
    heartbeats/<agent>.json        # liveness + current task + session_id
    inboxes/<agent>/               # messages addressed to <agent>
    inboxes/<agent>/_state/        # per-message read/replied/archived state
    inboxes/shared/                # broadcasts
    inboxes/<agent>/processed/     # archived (handled) messages
    claims/<task-id>.json          # atomic task claim tokens
    consensus/active/              # in-flight votes
    consensus/resolved/            # tallied votes
    reviews/                       # review reports
    handoffs/<task-id>-<session>.json  # structured handoff notes (§3.3)
  worklogs/<agent_id>.jsonl        # per-agent audit trail (WHY) — see below
```

**Worklog contract** (`autoclaw.worklog.v1`, `src/orchestrator/worklog.ts`):
one JSONL entry per lifecycle event with `ts`, `agent_id`, `task_id`, `kind`
(`claim`/`complete`/`review_vote`/`release`/`handoff`/`note`), and — the part
nothing else records — `initiative`, `sprint`, and a one-line `rationale`.
Write through `appendWorklogEntry` (never hand-roll the JSON; two legacy
hand-written dialects already exist and are normalized on read). Handoff
notes that carry `initiative`/`sprint_label` emit a `complete` entry
automatically. The fleet panel reads this trail to label tasks with their
initiative/sprint context.

### 2.1 Agent id vs session id — both matter

- **`agent_id`** identifies the *host* (`claude-code`, `kilocode`,
  `cursor`, `kiro`, `gemini-cli`, …). Stable. One row in `registry.json`.
- **`session_id`** identifies *this specific run* (a UUID). **Every
  message and heartbeat you emit MUST carry your `session_id`.**

This is how AutoClaw tells two concurrent Claude Code windows apart. If you
do not stamp `session_id`, a second session on the same host is invisible
and **will collide with you**. Generate one UUIDv4 at REGISTER and reuse it
for the whole session.

### 2.2 Heartbeat file (write at REGISTER and every LOOP)

```json
{
  "agent_id": "claude-code",
  "session_id": "8227eae6-64c8-48cd-a0a7-3fb1751da30b",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-21T06:31:15.543Z",
  "status": "active",            // active | working | reviewing | idle | watch | halted
  "current_task": "B1",
  "sprint": 2,
  "cycle": 7,
  "host_pid": 12345
}
```

A heartbeat older than `config.yaml → agents.heartbeat_stall_seconds`
(default 300s) marks the session **stalled**; the orchestrator drops it
from consensus quorum and may reassign its claimed task.

---

## 3. Message contract

One message = one JSON file. Filename:

```
<sortable-ts>-<type>-<agent_id>-<short-session>.json
```

Use `time_ns()` or ISO-with-millis for `<sortable-ts>` — **never
whole-second timestamps** (two sends in one second silently overwrite).
Append a 6–8 char `session_id` fragment so two sessions on the same host
never collide.

```json
{
  "id": "msg-<uuid>",
  "from": "claude-code",
  "session_id": "8227eae6-64c8-48cd-a0a7-3fb1751da30b",
  "to": "kilocode",                 // an agent id, or "shared", or "all"
  "type": "review_request",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-21T06:31:15.543Z",
  "sprint": 2,
  "task_id": "B1",
  "requires_response": true,
  "response_deadline": "2026-05-22T06:31:15Z",
  "payload": { }
}
```

### 3.1 Message types

| Type | Direction | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `task_assign` | orchestrator → agent | Sprint/task assigned; read `payload.brief`. |
| `task_claim` | agent → shared | "I am taking task X" (paired with a claim token). |
| `task_complete` | agent → shared | Task done; work is on branch `payload.branch`. |
| `review_request` | agent → agent | Please review my completed work. |
| `review_response` | agent → agent | Verdict on a review (`approve`/`request_changes`/`reject`). |
| `consensus_vote` | agent → consensus | A vote on task approval. |
| `revision_request` | orchestrator → author | Dissent in consensus (`request_changes`/`reject`) with rounds left: address the dissenting comments and re-broadcast `task_complete` for another vote round. |
| `finding_report` | agent → shared | Security/quality/conflict finding. |
| `question` / `answer` | agent ↔ agent | Cross-scope coordination Q&A. |
| `capability_query` / `capability_offer` | orchestrator ↔ agent | Capability discovery. |
| `subcontract_request` / `_accept` / `_deliver` / `_ack` / `_reject_with_fixes` | parent ↔ child | Work subcontracting fanout. |
| `heartbeat` | agent → bus | Liveness (usually written to the heartbeat file, not inbox). |
| `scope_violation` | orchestrator → agent | You touched a file outside your scope. |

### 3.2 Idempotency — the rule that prevents inbox storms

**Read a message exactly once.** On first successful read:

1. Write/update `inboxes/<agent>/_state/<msg-id>.json` with `read_at`.
2. Act on the message.
3. Move the file to `inboxes/<agent>/processed/` (atomic rename).
4. Record `responded_at` in the `state.json` `message_ledger` keyed by
   `msg.id`.

Never re-process a file in `processed/`. Never re-fire a `review_request`
for a `task_complete` whose `id` is already in the ledger. The classic bug
(see [AGENT_DAEMON_CRITIQUE.md](AGENT_DAEMON_CRITIQUE.md) §2.1) is a daemon
that re-sends a review request every poll because it never moved the source
file — within an hour the peer's inbox has hundreds of duplicates.

### 3.3 Handoff notes — the anti-racing brief

**Before broadcasting `task_complete`, every agent MUST write a handoff note
sidecar** to `comms/handoffs/<task-id>-<first-8-chars-session-id>.json` and
reference it in the task_complete payload as `payload.handoff_note`.

Without handoff notes, the next claimant has no structured context: which
files were touched, which are clean and safe to edit, what tests ran, or
what risks exist. Four agents racing on the same UI file is the predictable
result of omitting this step.

The handoff note schema (enforced by `src/orchestrator/handoff.ts`):

```json
{
  "task_id": "editor-command-api",
  "agent_id": "claude-code",
  "session_id": "<uuid>",
  "timestamp": "<iso>",
  "files_changed": ["src/commands/editorApi.ts"],
  "files_not_touched": ["src/views/fleetPanel.ts"],
  "integration_points": ["EditorCommand interface exported from src/commands/index.ts"],
  "tests_run": [{ "suite": "npm run test:unit", "passed": 12, "failed": 0 }],
  "risks": [],
  "next_agent_requested": "kilocode",
  "next_task_suggested": "editor-viewport",
  "summary": "Implemented EditorCommand API with create/update/delete.",
  "branch": "feat/editor-command-api"
}
```

Three OPTIONAL enrichment fields (additive — old notes without them remain
valid) carry what the next agent otherwise has to reconstruct:

- `open_questions: string[]` — things the completing agent could NOT resolve
  and the successor inherits (unverified assumptions, undecided seams).
  Distinct from `risks`, which are known hazards in the finished work.
- `decisions: [{ decision, chosen_option, confidence?, key_risk?, evidence_ref? }]`
  — per-decision rationale, field-compatible with the decision journal
  (`src/intelligence/kg/decisionJournal.ts`) so entries can be promoted to
  durable, calibrated KG decisions.
- `budget_remaining: { tokens?, wall_clock_minutes?, cost_cents? }` — runway
  left in the lane. Report only budgets you actually track; never estimate
  one into existence.

A task_complete with no `payload.handoff_note` is treated as incomplete by
the orchestrator and will not transition the board task to `Done`. The
`readHandoffNote(root, taskId)` helper in `src/orchestrator/handoff.ts`
lets the next claimant read the brief before editing a single file.

### 3.4 The worklog — WHY, not just WHAT

The task ledger records state transitions; the **worklog** records the
rationale behind them. One append-only JSONL file per agent at
`.autoclaw/orchestrator/worklogs/<agent_id>.jsonl`, schema
`autoclaw.worklog.v1` (owned by `src/orchestrator/worklog.ts`):

```json
{
  "schema": "autoclaw.worklog.v1",
  "ts": "<iso>",
  "agent_id": "claude-code",
  "session_id": "<uuid>",
  "task_id": "B1",
  "kind": "claim",
  "initiative": "editor-api",
  "sprint": "2",
  "rationale": "One content-safe line of WHY (capped at 500 chars).",
  "files_touched": ["src/commands/editorApi.ts"],
  "refs": ["comms/claims/B1.json"]
}
```

`kind` is one of `claim | complete | review_vote | release | handoff | note`.
The fleet panel renders this stream as the per-task "worklog context", so a
missing entry means your reasoning is invisible to the next claimant.

Three lifecycle events append entries **automatically** — do not duplicate
them by hand:

- `claim` — the MCP `claim.task` tool, on a won claim.
- `review_vote` — the MCP `consensus.vote` tool, and the Review Fleet's
  automated vote writer.
- `handoff` — `writeHandoffNote` (the task_complete prerequisite above).

Everything else (`note`, `release`, mid-task decisions) is yours to append —
use `appendWorklogEntry` when you have the code path, or hand-append one
JSON line matching the shape above. Legacy dialects (`at`/`action` or
`ts`/`kind`) are both normalized on read, but new writes should use the
canonical field names. The rationale line is **content-safe by contract**:
no prompts, no code, no secrets — one sentence of intent.

---

## 4. Claiming work without collisions

Two agents must never both "take" the same task. The claim is a
**create-exclusive** write:

0. **Check the review-queue WIP gate first (CP-2.3).** Before CLAIM, read the
   board (`board.json`): if `wip_gate.gated` is true, the review queue is at
   capacity (`depth ≥ cap`), the `claimable` lane is empty, and **you must not
   claim** — claiming while gated is a protocol violation, and the orchestrator's
   backstop will release any claim you create while gated (archived to
   `claims/_reaped/` with a `finding_report`). Instead, if you are a reviewer,
   clear a pending review to drain the queue; otherwise back off until the gate
   reopens. "Gates, not nags": the fleet cannot outrun its reviewers.
1. Pick the highest-priority task that is (a) unclaimed, (b) inside a
   scope you are allowed to touch, (c) has all `depends_on` satisfied.
2. Attempt to create `comms/claims/<task-id>.json` — **fail if it already
   exists** (`O_EXCL` / `wx` flag / `create_file` that errors on
   existing). The filesystem create-exclusive is your mutex.
3. If creation succeeds you own the task. Contents:
   ```json
   {
     "task_id": "B1",
     "claimed_by": "claude-code",
     "session_id": "8227eae6-...",
     "claim_token": "<uuid>",
     "claimed_at": "2026-05-21T06:32:00Z",
     "expires_at": "2026-05-21T08:32:00Z"
   }
   ```
4. If creation fails, someone else owns it — pick the next task.
5. A claim whose `expires_at` has passed **and** whose owner's heartbeat is
   stale may be stolen: delete the stale claim, then retry step 2.

The orchestrator's `src/orchestrator/claim.ts` implements this; agents
without that code path emulate it with create-exclusive file writes.

---

## 5. The hardened loop — stop conditions are mandatory

The old prompts said _"proceed in a `/loop` forever"_ and _"Do not stop."_
That is how you get a runaway token bill and four agents fighting over the
same file. A real coordination loop **always** has exit conditions.

### 5.1 Every cycle, in order

1. **Write heartbeat** (status, cycle count, current task).
2. **Check HALT conditions** (§5.2). If any is true → write a final
   heartbeat with `status: "halted"`, send a `finding_report` explaining
   why, stop.
3. **SYNC** the inbox. Messages requiring a response are handled before
   new work is claimed.
4. **CLAIM** a task. If none is claimable → go to §5.3 (watch mode).
5. **WORK** + **REPORT**.
6. Increment `cycle`. Repeat.

### 5.2 HALT conditions (stop the loop entirely)

| Condition | Why |
|---|---|
| User issued a stop / the session prompt changed. | Human override always wins. |
| `cycle` ≥ `max_cycles` (default **25**). | Hard cost ceiling. Re-arm explicitly to continue. |
| Cumulative cost ≥ budget cap (if a cost ledger is configured). | Cost ceiling. |
| A `scope_violation` was raised against you. | You are out of bounds; stop and let a human resolve. |
| An unresolved merge conflict in your scope. | Never paper over a conflict; surface it. |
| `state.json` is unreadable / the comms tree is gone. | The bus is broken; do not freewheel. |
| All sprints are `merged` and no follow-up backlog exists. | The work is genuinely done. |

### 5.3 Watch mode — the answer to "what do I do when idle"

When there is **no claimable task and the inbox is empty**, do **not** spin
burning tokens, and do **not** invent busywork. Instead:

1. On the **first** idle cycle, do one round of genuinely useful
   low-risk work, picking from this backlog (highest first):
   - Review an open `review_request` addressed to you.
   - Vote on an open item in `comms/consensus/active/` (the FULL path is `.autoclaw/orchestrator/comms/consensus/active/` — votes written to `.autoclaw/orchestrator/consensus/active/` land where no tally looks; the loop adopts strays, but write to the right place).
   - Gap analysis: diff `tasks.md` ↔ `state.json` ↔ sprint YAMLs; raise a
     `finding_report` for any drift (do **not** auto-fix).
   - Security pass on the most recent merged sprint's diff; file findings.
   - Add/strengthen unit tests for an under-tested component in your scope.
   - Spider new `TODO` / `// AI:` comments; capture them as notes.
2. If still idle after that, set heartbeat `status: "watch"` and **back
   off**: sleep/yield with an increasing interval (e.g. 2 → 5 → 10 min,
   capped). Watch mode is cheap; busy-spinning is not.
3. Leave watch mode immediately when a message arrives or a task unblocks.

### 5.4 Coexisting with other live sessions

Another agent (a second Claude Code window, a Kilo session, …) is often
running at the same time. Rules:

- **Trust the claim file, not your memory.** Before working a task,
  confirm `comms/claims/<task-id>.json` is yours (`session_id` matches).
- **Never touch a file outside your claimed scope.** If you need to, send a
  `question` to the scope owner and wait — do not edit and apologize later.
- **Branch isolation.** Work on the assignment's branch only. Before any
  push, `git diff --stat` against sibling agent branches; if you both
  touched a file, raise a `finding_report` instead of racing the push.
- **Stamp `session_id` on everything** so the orchestrator can attribute
  actions when two sessions share an `agent_id`.
- **Declare a file-scope lease before you edit (CL-4).** Announce the globs
  you are about to touch so a peer editing the same files is caught *before*
  the clobber, not after. Write
  `comms/leases/<agent>-<session>.json`:
  `{ agent_id, session_id, globs: ["src/foo.ts","src/bar/**"], branch, created_at, expires_at }`.
  An overlapping lease held by a different session produces a `scope_violation`
  finding — stop and coordinate. In-IDE agents have the commands **AutoClaw:
  Declare File-Scope Lease** / **Release File-Scope Lease** / **File-Scope
  Leases — Status & Overlaps**; the lease is the machine-readable form of the
  "who's editing what" question. Release (or let it expire) when done. This is
  the structural guard against the two-windows-one-file collision — it does not
  replace branch isolation, it complements it.

---

## 6. Per-host dispatch & capability matrix

Hosts differ in three ways that change how you run the loop: whether they
can be **dispatched headlessly** (a runner) or need a **bridge**, whether
they have a **subagent** primitive, and what **loop mechanism** is native.

| Host | Dispatch model | Subagents? | Native loop mechanism | Identity / inbox |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | Runner (Claude Agent SDK headless) | ✅ `Agent` tool | `/loop` skill, `ScheduleWakeup`, background Bash | `claude-code` |
| **Kilo Code** | **Bridge required** (chat-only VS Code ext) | ❌ in-session only | Self-paced in-session; bridge re-prompts | `kilocode` |
| **Cursor** | Runner (`cursor-agent` headless) | ❌ in-session only | In-session loop; runner re-dispatch | `cursor` |
| **Kiro** | Runner (`kiro-cli chat --no-interactive`) | ❌ in-session only | In-session loop; `--resume-id` re-dispatch | `kiro` |
| **Gemini CLI / Antigravity** | Runner (`gemini -p`) | ⚠️ browser sub-agent only | In-session loop; runner re-dispatch | `gemini-cli` |
| **Cline / Continue / Windsurf** | In-session (no headless CLI yet) | ❌ in-session only | Self-paced in-session | `cline` / `continue` / `windsurf` |
| **Codex / Hermes / OpenClaw** | Runner (CLI / REST) | varies | Runner / Mission-Control driven | `codex` / `hermes` / `openclaw` |

What this means for the loop:

- **Runner hosts** can be woken by the orchestrator flipping
  `agents/<agent>/ready`. The loop survives between dispatches because the
  orchestrator re-invokes the runner. State lives entirely in the comms
  tree — never assume in-memory continuity.
- **Bridge hosts (Kilo)** cannot be woken headlessly. The loop is
  **self-paced in one chat session**; the bridge extension auto-submits
  the next prompt when `ready` flips. If no bridge is installed, the loop
  is human-tapped — fire an OS toast so the tap is one click.
- **Subagent-capable hosts (Claude Code only)** may fan a single claimed
  task out to parallel `Agent` subagents (Researcher/Coder/Reviewer/
  Verifier — see `/mateam`). **Cap the fanout** (default ≤ 4 concurrent;
  see §8). Every other host plays those roles sequentially in-session and
  must **not** fabricate an `Agent` call.

## 7. Copy-paste bootstrap prompts

Paste the block for your host at the start of a coordinated session. Each
block is self-contained and references this document for the full rules.

### 7.1 Claude Code

```text
You are joining an AutoClaw-orchestrated project as agent `claude-code`.
Follow docs/AGENT_SESSION_PROTOCOL.md exactly.

REGISTER: generate a session UUID; write .autoclaw/orchestrator/comms/
heartbeats/claude-code.json with it; ensure you have a row in registry.json.

Then run the six-phase loop (REGISTER→SYNC→CLAIM→WORK→REPORT→LOOP):
- SYNC: read your inbox + shared/, handle each message, move handled files
  to processed/, update the state.json ledger. Answer anything with
  requires_response before claiming new work.
- CLAIM: read sprints/plan-summary.yaml; claim ONE unclaimed in-scope task
  via create-exclusive write to comms/claims/<task-id>.json. Respect
  depends_on. Confirm the claim file's session_id is yours before working.
- WORK: only inside the claimed scope, on the assignment branch. For tasks
  spanning ≥3 files or needing research, fan out to Agent subagents
  (Researcher→Coder→Reviewer→Verifier) — cap at 4 concurrent. Small tasks:
  do them in-session.
- REPORT: broadcast task_complete to shared/, send review_request to peers,
  vote on open comms/consensus/active/ items.
- LOOP: write a heartbeat each cycle. HALT on any §5.2 condition (default
  max 25 cycles). When idle, enter watch mode (§5.3): do one round of
  review / gap-analysis / security / testing, then back off — do NOT spin.

Stamp your session_id on every message and heartbeat. Stay in scope.
Coordinate cross-scope changes with a `question` message. Report honestly:
if tests fail, say so. Begin with REGISTER + SYNC and tell me what you found.
```

To make the loop actually recur on Claude Code, wrap it:
`/loop /agent-session` (if packaged as a skill) — or use `ScheduleWakeup`
between cycles. The `/loop` skill self-paces; keep `max_cycles` as the
real ceiling.

### 7.2 Kilo Code

```text
You are joining an AutoClaw-orchestrated project as agent `kilocode`.
Follow .clinerules/cross-agent-protocol.md and docs/AGENT_SESSION_PROTOCOL.md.

You have NO subagent primitive and NO headless mode — run the whole loop
in THIS chat session, playing every role yourself. Do not fabricate an
`Agent` tool call.

REGISTER: generate a session UUID; write comms/heartbeats/kilocode.json.
Then loop REGISTER→SYNC→CLAIM→WORK→REPORT→LOOP as in the protocol:
- SYNC inbox + shared/, handle + archive messages.
- CLAIM one in-scope task via create-exclusive write to comms/claims/.
- WORK in scope, on the assignment branch.
- REPORT task_complete + review_request + consensus votes.
- LOOP: heartbeat each cycle; HALT after 25 cycles or on any §5.2 stop
  condition; watch mode + backoff when idle.

If the AutoClaw Kilo bridge is installed it will re-submit the next cycle
for you; if not, end each cycle by telling me to say "continue".
Begin with REGISTER + SYNC.
```

### 7.3 Cursor

```text
You are joining an AutoClaw-orchestrated project as agent `cursor`.
Follow adapters/cursor/cross-agent.mdc and docs/AGENT_SESSION_PROTOCOL.md.

No subagent primitive — play all roles in-session. You may be re-dispatched
headlessly by the orchestrator via `cursor-agent`; assume NO in-memory
continuity between dispatches — re-read state.json each cycle.

Run REGISTER→SYNC→CLAIM→WORK→REPORT→LOOP. Heartbeat every cycle to
comms/heartbeats/cursor.json with your session_id. HALT after 25 cycles or
any §5.2 condition; watch mode when idle. Begin with REGISTER + SYNC.
```

### 7.4 Kiro

```text
You are joining an AutoClaw-orchestrated project as agent `kiro`.
Follow adapters/kiro/cross-agent.md and docs/AGENT_SESSION_PROTOCOL.md.

No subagent primitive — play all roles in-session. The orchestrator may
re-dispatch you with `kiro-cli chat --no-interactive --resume-id <id>`;
treat each dispatch as stateless — re-read state.json and your heartbeat.

Run REGISTER→SYNC→CLAIM→WORK→REPORT→LOOP. Heartbeat to
comms/heartbeats/kiro.json each cycle with session_id. HALT after 25
cycles or any §5.2 condition; watch mode when idle. Begin with REGISTER.
```

### 7.5 Gemini CLI / Antigravity

```text
You are joining an AutoClaw-orchestrated project as agent `gemini-cli`.
Follow adapters/antigravity/cross-agent.md and
docs/AGENT_SESSION_PROTOCOL.md.

In-session loop only (the browser sub-agent is not a coordination
primitive). The orchestrator re-dispatches you via `gemini -p`; assume
stateless dispatch — re-read state.json each cycle.

Run REGISTER→SYNC→CLAIM→WORK→REPORT→LOOP. Heartbeat to
comms/heartbeats/gemini-cli.json each cycle with session_id. HALT after 25
cycles or any §5.2 condition; watch mode when idle. Begin with REGISTER.
```

## 8. Safety rails (the difference from the naive prompt)

| Naive prompt said | This protocol does instead |
|---|---|
| "`/loop` forever / do not stop" | Bounded loop; `max_cycles` ceiling; explicit HALT conditions (§5.2). |
| "launch as many agents as needed" | Subagent fanout capped (default ≤ 4 concurrent); only Claude Code fans out at all. |
| "keep working / always be doing something" | Watch mode + exponential backoff when genuinely idle (§5.3) — no token-burning busy-spin. |
| "another session is running, don't conflict" | `session_id` on every message; create-exclusive claim files; scope + branch isolation (§5.4). |
| "check the heartbeat and messages" | Heartbeat every cycle; stale-heartbeat detection drops dead sessions from quorum. |
| (unstated) cost | Optional cost-ledger budget cap as a HALT condition. |
| (unstated) drift | Reconciliation / gap-analysis is the *first* watch-mode task, and surfaces drift as a `finding_report` rather than silently auto-fixing. |
| (unstated) honesty | REPORT states real results — failed tests are reported as failed, skipped steps as skipped. |

**Hard rules, never violated:**

1. Never edit a file outside your claimed scope.
2. Never re-process a message already in `processed/` or the ledger.
3. Never claim a task whose claim file you do not own.
4. Never run an unbounded loop — `max_cycles` and §5.2 are not optional.
5. Never fabricate a subagent call on a host without the primitive.
6. Never auto-fix drift/conflicts silently — surface them.

## 9. Relationship to AutoClaw skills & V3 plan

- `/orchestrate` (→ `/sprint` in v3) plans the DAG and writes the sprint
  YAMLs this protocol reads.
- `/mateam` (→ `/team`) is the in-task role pipeline a single CLAIM may
  invoke during WORK.
- `/kdream` (→ `/dream` + `/recall`) is the memory layer; watch-mode notes
  feed it.
- The runner/bridge dispatch model is specified in
  [rfc/runner-bridge-contract.md](rfc/runner-bridge-contract.md); this
  protocol is the *agent-side* contract that complements it.
- Workstream A of [V3_PLAN.md](V3_PLAN.md) hardens the orchestrator side of
  this same bus (state machine, atomic claims, inbox state machine,
  reconciliation). This document and that workstream must stay consistent.

## 10. Peers without a native bridge (Hermes / OpenClaw / Codex-CLI / another IDE)

Any tool that can speak one of four transports can join a project as a teammate —
it does not need the VS Code extension. The full design is
[ideas/FLEET-FEDERATION-SELF-HEALING.md](ideas/FLEET-FEDERATION-SELF-HEALING.md)
(invite tokens, self-healing, self-aware role election) and
[ideas/STANDARDIZED-ADAPTER-A2A-PLATFORM.md](ideas/STANDARDIZED-ADAPTER-A2A-PLATFORM.md)
(the `acp/1` connector standard). This section is the agent-side on-ramp.

### 10.1 The join handshake (all peers)

```
1. (token)    A human runs "AutoClaw: Invite Agent to Project…" → hands you a
              single-use, scoped, TTL'd invite token (src/fleet/invites.ts).
2. REGISTER   Consume the token (single-use), then write a BEACON — the
              presence equivalent of a heartbeat (src/fleet/beacons.ts):
              { agent_id, session_id, timestamp, status, role, agent_type,
                host, workspace, transports[], card_url }.
3. (admit)    You appear in the panel's pending tray at trust:off. The user
              Admits you (writes you into fleet.json with a role) — or, under an
              auto-preapproved admit policy, a matching agent_type is admitted
              automatically. The user's fleet.json role is authoritative.
4. LOOP       Each cycle: heartbeat (beacon) → SYNC inbox (any lane) → read
              needs.json and offer the role the project needs (capability_offer)
              → CLAIM a lane (scope-lease, not a file) → WORK → REPORT
              (task_complete + review_request) → back off when idle.
```

This is the §1 six-phase loop with two substitutions for non-native peers:
**heartbeat → beacon** (so a non-VS-Code tool checks in) and, where the project
coordinates code via PRs, **claim-file → PR + scope-lease**.

### 10.2 Three on-ramps by tool shape

**A. MCP-capable CLI (Codex / CodeGPT / Copilot) → MCP lane (no file/HTTP plumbing).**
Mount AutoClaw's MCP server and call tools directly:
- `presence.beacon` — check in (you become a fleet row). *This is the tool that
  closes the gap where MCP agents could message + claim but not be visible.*
- `presence.fleet` — see who else is live.
- `inbox.send` / `inbox.read` / `claim.task` / `consensus.vote` — coordinate.
No file paths, no HTTP server — just tool calls.

**B. REST runner (Hermes / AutoGPT) → HTTP bridge lane.**
`POST /api/v1/heartbeat` each cycle (or drop a machine beacon — both land in the
same view), subscribe to the SSE `…/messages/stream` for push (or poll
`/messages`), and serve your Agent Card at your `endpoint` + `/.well-known/agent.json`
so the router can score your capabilities. To take work, **claim a board task over
HTTP**: `POST /api/v1/claims/<task_id>` (Bearer token; optional JSON
`{ sprint_id, ttl_hours }`). It is create-exclusive — `201` with a `claim_token` on
success, `409 { reason:"conflict", owner }` if already claimed — the HTTP twin of the
`claim.task` MCP tool. Report the result with `POST /api/v1/messages`
(`type:"task_complete"`, `payload.task_id`); the orchestrator folds it into the board.

**C. Shell / file-only tool (OpenClaw, any one-liner) → filesystem lane.**
Write a beacon to `~/.autoclaw/beacons/<id>.json` (or the documented `node -e`
one-liner), write message files into `comms/inboxes/<to>/` using the §3 filename
convention, and honor idempotency (read once → `_state/<id>.json` → move to
`processed/`). Cross-machine is the relay (`src/cloud/relay.ts`) pointed at a
self-hosted relay server.

### 10.3 Beacon vs. heartbeat (so you don't write both wrong)

A beacon is a **superset of** the §2 heartbeat — same identity fields plus
`host` / `workspace` / `origin` / `transports[]` / `card_url`. A native VS Code
agent writes a heartbeat; an external peer writes a beacon; the panel merges
both into one fleet view. Keep the identity fields (`agent_id`, `session_id`,
`workspace_id`) consistent with any session you later let the intelligence layer
ingest — do not fork a second identity model.

### 10.4 What the project needs (self-aware arrival)

Before claiming blindly, read `.autoclaw/orchestrator/needs.json` (the role
coverage gap, open lanes, staleness pressure). Score your own skills against the
gap and `capability_offer` the role you best fill — a crowd of arrivals then
self-distributes across needs instead of dogpiling one lane
(`src/fleet/roleElection.ts`).
