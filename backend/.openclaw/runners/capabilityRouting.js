/**
 * capabilityRouting.ts — Capability-aware arm of the multi-agent recursive
 * learning loop (extends BL-7 reputation routing).
 *
 * ## Background
 *
 * `reputationPreference.ts` (BL-7) wires the overall reputation ledger into the
 * §5.5 preference order so the "best overall" runner is preferred. That works
 * well when tasks are generic, but the learning loop becomes more valuable when
 * it can say:
 *
 *   "agent A has an 80 % security success rate vs. agent B's 40 % — route this
 *    security task to A, even if their *overall* rates are similar."
 *
 * This module is the capability-specific counterpart: it scopes the reputation
 * lookup to a single capability tag (e.g. `"security"`, `"test"`, `"refactor"`)
 * so the returned `reputationByRunnerId` map reflects each agent's track record
 * for THAT capability only. Under the hood it delegates to
 * `reputationFactor(rep, capability, minSamples)`, which already implements the
 * right fallback: when an agent has no samples for the requested capability it
 * returns the neutral prior (0.9) instead of penalising them — so routing stays
 * useful even when the ledger is young.
 *
 * ### Integration points
 *
 * - Reads the outcomes ledger via `readTrackRecord` / `aggregateReputation`
 *   from `../reputation/ledger` — same source of truth as BL-7.
 * - Passes `reputationByRunnerId` to `RunnerRegistry.getPreferred` via
 *   `dispatchViaRegistry` — same §5.5 preference seam as BL-7.
 * - Callers that already use `dispatchPreferredByReputation` (overall) can
 *   switch to `dispatchPreferredForCapability` (scoped) by adding a
 *   `capability` field; the rest of the dispatch contract is unchanged.
 *
 * ### Cold-start / sparse-ledger safety
 *
 * - Empty ledger → `buildCapabilityReputationPreference` returns `{}`, which is
 *   a safe no-op: `getPreferred` falls through to the next criterion in the
 *   §5.5 order (cost, latency, registration order).
 * - An agent with fewer than `minSamples` (default 3) capability-specific
 *   outcomes receives the neutral prior (0.9) so newcomers are never penalised.
 * - An agent with zero capability-specific outcomes but enough overall outcomes
 *   falls back to their overall `success_rate` via `reputationFactor`'s
 *   documented behaviour (the `c && c.samples > 0` branch does not fire, so
 *   `samples` / `rate` stay on the overall values — but those overall samples
 *   may also be < minSamples, giving the neutral prior; see ledger.ts:196-208).
 *
 * @see src/runners/reputationPreference.ts  — overall-reputation counterpart
 * @see src/reputation/ledger.ts             — `reputationFactor`, `aggregateReputation`
 * @see docs/rfc/runner-bridge-contract.md   — §5.5 preference order
